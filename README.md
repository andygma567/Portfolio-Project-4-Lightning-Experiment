# Portfolio-Project-4-Lightning-Experiment

This project is an unfinished personal project where I am attempting to create artwork using GANs. 

In this repository is a PyTorch Lightning implementation of FreezeD transfer learning on StyleGAN version 1 (originally trained on a dataset of real faces). 

Previously I also experiemented with using a Keras model to create images of pokemon via a DCGAN with an R1 Type zero-centered gradient penalty that I am also including in this repository for reference.
